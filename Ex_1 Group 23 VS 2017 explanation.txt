[How to open]
To open the project open 'Template_2017.sln' with an appropriate Visual Studio distributoin.
Visual Studio migth not set SimulationsRunner as start porject.

[Know issues]
When applying gravity the simulations migth got wild after some time passes,
as gravity gets applied to each points velocity and is not resolved unless in touches the ground.
